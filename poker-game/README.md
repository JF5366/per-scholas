Heads Up Texas Hold’em Poker
===============================
By Jennifer Foster
-------------------------------
Players: human vs computer opponent
-------------------------------
Game Objective: Just like real poker, win as much money as you can; try not to lose all your money.
-------------------------------
Gameplay:
When the game loads, click “yes” or “no” to start gameplay
Round 1 will begin
Cards will be randomized and dealt: 2 private cards for each player, and 5 community cards.	
Minimum bet is 100$ from each player, which goes into the pot to be won
The winner of the round is calculated from the best 5 card poker hand using the necessary cards from the community and a particular player's private cards. 
Like poker, Texas hold'em hand rankings from weakest to strongest, are as follows:
High card
One pair
Two pair
Three-of-a-kind
Straight
Flush
Full house
Four-of-a-kind
Straight flush
Royal Flush
The winner of the round is awarded the “pot” of 200$, added to their bank account.
The player has the option to begin the next round, or leave the game.

Ideas for Future Updates:
Add more players
Ability to change the amount the player bets, and to add more betting rounds between the flop, turn and river. 
Change to one image, and have it translate x/y coordinates as the cards change, so I can make the code for the changing images more DRY
